# MSEV-TQS

## Project Abstract

This project, developed in the scope of TQS, aims to develop a full stack web application while applying good testing and quality assurance guidelines in a CI/CD environment. Our application, named Manage Stations for Electric Vehicles (MSEV), aims to integrate several charging stations networks into one, to make it easier for drivers to find, book and charge their vehicles. Coming as a solution for improving the electric vehicle ecosystem it creates a platform that allows drivers to search, book and pay charging services across several integrated charging networks. At the same time, charging stations owners will be able to register their stations and also manage their availability, prices and maintenance.
